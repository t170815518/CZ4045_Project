with all_views as (select * from information_schema.views  where table_schema != 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA')
SELECT * FROM TABLE(get_object_references(database_name=>all_views.TABLE_CATALOG, schema_name=>all_views.TABLE_SCHEMA, object_name=>all_views.TABLE_NAME));

I ran the above query in snowflake but getting the below error.

SQL compilation error: schema object identifier 'ALL_VIEWS.TABLE_CATALOG.ALL_VIEWS.TABLE_SCHEMA.ALL_VIEWS.TABLE_NAME' has too many qualifiers
What i want to do? I want all the available view's source table in a database,

What i tried? below query gives the source table of a particular view under a given schema and database.

SELECT * FROM TABLE(get_object_references(database_name=>'<db_name>', schema_name=>'<schema_name>', object_name=>'<view_name>'));
And below query gives all the views under a database

select * from information_schema.views where table_schema != 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA'
So i thought of combining these two queries to give me source tables of all the available views in a database but the above error is thrown.

Is this even the correct way or is there a way to achieve what i want? Thanks.
