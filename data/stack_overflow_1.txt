My app has a Catalog screen that displays a list of Items. 
All Items are loaded at app startup using a backend Rest API call. 
When an Item from this list is clicked, it shows Item details on a new screen. 
The app also has a MyCart screen that displays a list of Items currently in the cart. 
Clicking on any Item in the cart displays the same Item details screen.

I would like to cache the Items within the app in a Map (ItemId as key and Item object as value). 
I do not want the database or a local file cache because I want items to be fetched whenever the app starts up. 
Since an Item detail (such a its price) may change on the backend, I want the Item to fetched fresh from the backend whenever Item details screen is shown. Fetching an Item would also update the cache.

My question are:
    Is this already a pattern (or an anti-pattern) in flutter?
    Whether there already is some kind of object cache package? Ideally, the cache would have ability to fetch the data from the backend if there is a cache miss. I saw there is weak_map package and flutter_cs_cache package but neither of them seem to be doing this sort of stuff.
thank you!
